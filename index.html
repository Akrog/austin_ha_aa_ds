# API Races

Didn't diverge from approach agreed in Tokyo:

- Compare-and-swap was used
- Generic conditional update mechanism added to OVOs
    * Base functionality merged
    * Merged patches using base functionality
    * Some patches required changes to SQLAlchemy
        - SQLAlchemy has been updated
        - Now patches can be merged
- API returns Generic errors (no loops)

.mildgreen[Status: Patches need reviewing and at least 1 needs to be redone]

# Job Distribution (I) - Mechanism

.center.medium[![](assets/job_distribution.svg)]

---

# Job Distribution (II) - Implementation (I)

- Cluster grouping is done by host (imagine it as a reverse proxy)
- Add node_name configuration option
- Add service_nodes table
    * Move fields from service table:
        + rpc_version
        + object_version
        + report_count
        + heartbeat
    * Moves require 2 releases (rolling upgrades)
        + In N &#10142; Compatibility code aggregates data from both tables
        + In O &#10142; Remove compatibility code and fields from service
- New mechanism for determining when service is up
- Disabling still at service level &#10142; Signals to drain node
---

# Job Distribution (III) - Implementation (II)

- New API microversion for Service list:
    * Returns service nodes summary with
        + Number of nodes under the host
        + Number of nodes that are down
        + Last heartbeat from the nodes
    * Optionally can return service nodes summary list 
- New "service_nodes" API endpoint:
    * Summary list
    * Detailed list
    * Show

.mildgreen[Status: Server and Client patches up for review]

# Job Distribution (IV) - Diverge from Tokyo

- Approach proposed in Tokyo:
    * Add cluster configuration option
    * Use cluster as message topic key
    * Change everywhere "host" with "cluster"

--

- Reasons for the change:
    * Complexity:
        + Rename of "host" with "cluster" &#10142; 12K LOC - High probability of introducing bugs
        + Multiple releases needed
        + Compatibility code for all APIs
    * Inconsistency:
        + In documentation
        + In existing APIs &#10142; Say host, but is actually cluster
        + Between configuration and APIs
    * Clean backports impossible with previous release
